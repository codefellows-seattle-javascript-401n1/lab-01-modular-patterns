The gulpfile should contain a task to run the mocha/assert test as well as run eslint on all of your code. This should include your tests and your gulpfile.  

## Bonus:  

* For an extra point, set up a watch task that reruns your tests/eslint on changes to any of your files (minus package.json)  
 * HINT: read the gulp docs :)
